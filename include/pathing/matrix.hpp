 * @brief A class to represent a mathematical matrix and perform operations on it.
 * 
 * The `Matrix` class is a data structure that represents a matrix and provides
 * methods to perform operations on it. The matrix is stored as a vector of vectors
 * of doubles, where each element is a double. The outer vector represents the rows
 * of the matrix, and each inner vector represents the columns of the matrix.
 * 
 * The class provides methods to perform basic matrix operations such as addition,
 * subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also provides methods to compute
 * the determinant, inverse, and reduced row echelon form of the matrix.
 * 
 * Auxiliary functions are provided to create identity, zeros, and ones matrices.
