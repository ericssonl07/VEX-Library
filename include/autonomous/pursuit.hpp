/**
 * @brief A class that implements the pure pursuit algorithm.
 * 
 * The pure pursuit algorithm is a path tracking algorithm that calculates the steering angle of a robot to follow a path.
 * It is based on the concept of a lookahead point, which is a point on the path that the robot is trying to reach, ahead
 * of the robot's current position by a certain distance.
 * 
 * The algorithm calculates the steering angle based on the distance between the robot and the lookahead point, and the
 * curvature of the path to reach the lookahead point.
 * 
 * By constantly "pursuing" the lookahead point, which stays on the path a fixed distance ahead of the robot, the robot can
 * follow the path accurately and smoothly as it constantly adjusts its steering angle to chase the moving target.

     * of forward-searching is that it allows the program to trace a closed path, whereas back-tracing would not (it would find
     * the end point and return that).
